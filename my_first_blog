alright let me go straight into whats goes on in my head.Well we all do common activites ,say even experience the same phenomena
but how we interpret them could be so different .Now that i think about it we ourselves on yet another day look upon those same occurences but in a totally different manner.
I hope u can relate to wat i am saying,well lets take an example perception of colour lets say we can just see everything around us trivially  but once we look deep (and deeper) break it down things start to get magical .
its just terrific .Now lets play a game shall we!!.I want everyone to just have a look around your surroundings.what do you see?
Alright assuming your at home sitting on a chair  inside a room.Now pick a colour any colour and look around you again .The magic unfolds
you endup finding any colour you choose almost always .sometimes you just need to probe deeper but thats fun too!! its the rgb spectrum that kindles my braincells.guys
i hope you'll are engulfed in the same aura as i am.Its,these simple things that have a lot to offer.This happens to be my fisrt blog People please do like,comment & share i will be sharing  more anecdotes and experiences soon .
